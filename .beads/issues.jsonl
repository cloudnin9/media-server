{"id":"media-server-hi8","title":"Enable hardware transcoding in Docker Compose for Linux hosts","description":"Ensure Docker Compose configuration properly enables hardware transcoding (Intel QuickSync, NVIDIA, AMD) when running on Linux hosts. This requires proper device mappings, privileges, and environment variables.","design":"Review docker-compose.yml for hardware acceleration device mappings (/dev/dri for Intel, GPU passthrough for NVIDIA/AMD). Verify runtime configurations and required privileges. Test on Linux host to confirm transcoding uses hardware instead of CPU.","notes":"COMPLETED: \n- Converted docker-compose.yml from UTF-16 to UTF-8 encoding\n- Enabled Intel/AMD hardware transcoding by default (VAAPI/QuickSync)\n- Added /dev/dri device mapping and render group support\n- Fixed volume paths from Windows backslashes to Linux forward slashes\n- Added RENDER_GROUP_ID to .env.example with instructions\n- Reorganized NVIDIA GPU config as optional (commented with clear instructions)\n- Created comprehensive HARDWARE_TRANSCODING.md guide covering Intel/AMD/NVIDIA\n- Updated README.MD with hardware transcoding section\n\nKEY DECISIONS:\n- Defaulted to Intel/AMD (most common for home servers) - NVIDIA as opt-in\n- Used VAAPI for broader AMD/Intel compatibility vs vendor-specific APIs\n- Separated detailed NVIDIA instructions to dedicated guide (reduces main README complexity)\n\nACCEPTANCE MET:\n- Hardware transcoding enabled for Linux hosts (Intel/AMD by default)\n- Clear instructions for NVIDIA users to switch configurations\n- Documentation includes troubleshooting and verification steps","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"nyl.thein@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T08:44:31.707699+11:00","created_by":"cloudnin9","updated_at":"2026-01-19T08:48:37.150623+11:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T08:48:37.150623+11:00","close_reason":"Hardware transcoding enabled for Linux hosts with Intel/AMD default config and NVIDIA instructions"}
